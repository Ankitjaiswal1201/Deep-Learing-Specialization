# Deep-Learing-Specialization


In this specialization, I learnt the foundations of Deep Learning, how to build neural networks and how to lead successful machine learning projects. I learnt about Convolutional networks, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. I worked on various case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading and many more. All these ideas were implemented in Python and in Tensorflow.
